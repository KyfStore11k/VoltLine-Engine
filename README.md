## Getting Started

You can install VoltLine Engine in 2 ways, either cloning the repo, and building it through MSVS, or downloading a release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/KyfStore11k/VoltLine-Engine/releases).

- ### Cloning Repo

1. **Clone the Repository**:

Clone the repository using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KyfStore11k/VoltLine-Engine.git
```

2. **Opening With MSVS (Microsoft Visual Studio)**:

Opening MSVS and select "Open a Project or Solution." Yours may be different, but just press a button along those lines. Naviagate the directory you cloned using GIT and select the `VoltLine-Engine.sln` solution file. This will open it in MSVS.

3. **Running and Building**:

To run VoltLine Engine, at the top menu bar, select `Local Windows Debugger` and select it. It should begin building it and executing the program. Once finished, it should open.

- ### Running a Release

1. **Downloading**:

Begin by downloading a recent release from the Releases page (link can be found above). You can either download a Debug program (with a debugging terminal) or a Release program (a clean no-terminal version). Select either type and download it.

2. **Running**:

When completed, unzip the file, enter the directory and you should see a file called: `VoltLine Engine.exe`. Execute the file and VoltLine-Engine should start up. If you downloaded the Debug version, a terminal should also open with it.
